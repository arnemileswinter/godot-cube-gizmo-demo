**Note: This project serves as an example for creating and using Gizmo Plugins in Godot 4.1.**

This is a simple Godot 4.1 scene containing a demo object that utilizes the `ExampleCubeGizmoPlugin`. The plugin allows you to interact with and manipulate a cube-shaped object in the 3D editor.

## Getting Started

2. Open the project in Godot Engine 4.1 or a later version.

3. Open the scene named `example.tscn`.

4. You should see a cube-shaped object in the 3D editor.

## How to Use the Gizmo

The `ExampleCubeGizmoPlugin` provides a gizmo for interacting with the cube object in the editor. Here's how to use it:

1. Select the cube-shaped object in the 3D editor.

2. You should see handles appear around the cube. There are three handles: one for each axis (X, Y, and Z).

3. Click and drag on the handles to resize the cube along the corresponding axis.

   - **X Handle**: Resize along the X-axis.
   - **Y Handle**: Resize along the Y-axis.
   - **Z Handle**: Resize along the Z-axis.

4. As you drag the handles, the cube will resize accordingly.

5. You can use this gizmo to adjust the cube's dimensions to your liking.
